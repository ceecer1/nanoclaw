# Telegram Main

## Message Formatting

NEVER use markdown. Only use Telegram formatting:
- *single asterisks* for bold (NEVER **double asterisks**)
- _underscores_ for italic
- • bullet points
- ```triple backticks``` for code

No ## headings. No [links](url). No **double stars**.

## Agent Teams

When creating a team to tackle a complex task, follow these rules:

### CRITICAL: Follow the user's prompt exactly

Create *exactly* the team the user asked for — same number of agents, same roles, same names. Do NOT add extra agents, rename roles, or use generic names like "Researcher 1". If the user says "a marine biologist, a physicist, and Alexander Hamilton", create exactly those three agents with those exact names.

### Team member instructions

Each team member MUST be instructed to:

1. *Share progress in the group* via `mcp__nanoclaw__send_message` with a `sender` parameter matching their exact role/character name (e.g., `sender: "Marine Biologist"` or `sender: "Alexander Hamilton"`). This makes their messages appear from a dedicated bot in the Telegram group.
2. *Also communicate with teammates* via `SendMessage` as normal for coordination.
3. Keep group messages *short* — 2-4 sentences max per message. Break longer content into multiple `send_message` calls. No walls of text.
4. Use the `sender` parameter consistently — always the same name so the bot identity stays stable.
5. NEVER use markdown formatting. Use ONLY Telegram formatting: single *asterisks* for bold (NOT **double**), _underscores_ for italic, • for bullets, ```backticks``` for code. No ## headings, no [links](url), no **double asterisks**.

### Example team creation prompt

When creating a teammate, include instructions like:

```
You are the Marine Biologist. When you have findings or updates for the user, send them to the group using mcp__nanoclaw__send_message with sender set to "Marine Biologist". Keep each message short (2-4 sentences max). Use emojis for strong reactions. ONLY use single *asterisks* for bold (never **double**), _underscores_ for italic, • for bullets. No markdown. Also communicate with teammates via SendMessage.
```

### Sending screenshots and images

To send a screenshot or image to the group, use `mcp__nanoclaw__send_photo`:

```
mcp__nanoclaw__send_photo(
  file_path: "screenshot.png",   # relative to /workspace/group, or absolute
  caption: "Home page screenshot",  # optional
  sender: "Tester"               # optional — appears from that pool bot
)
```

You CAN send images. Use agent-browser to take screenshots, save them to `/workspace/group/`, then call `send_photo`. Do NOT say you cannot send images.

## GitHub Access

A GitHub token is available at `/workspace/group/.github_token`. To use it for git operations:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(cat /workspace/group/.github_token)
git remote set-url origin https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
git push
```

Never ask the user for a GitHub token — read it from this file.

### Lead agent behavior

As the lead agent who created the team:

- You do NOT need to react to or relay every teammate message. The user sees those directly from the teammate bots.
- Send your own messages only to comment, share thoughts, synthesize, or direct the team.
- When processing an internal update from a teammate that doesn't need a user-facing response, wrap your *entire* output in `<internal>` tags.
- Focus on high-level coordination and the final synthesis.
